  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Miso Soup is a heartwarming Japanese soup that is easy to make with a few healthy ingredients! It is the ultimate comfort food and pairs well with a variety of dishes.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Miso past (red or white) </li>
    <li> Dashi stock (dried konbu, dried bonito flakes) </li>
    <li> Tofu </li>
    <li> Green onions </li>
    <li> Dry wakame seaweed (optional) </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps:</h2>
  <h3> Make Dashi Stock </h3>
  <ol>
    <li> Rehydrate your dried wakame by soaking under one cup of warm water for 10 minutes. Drain well. </li>
    <li> Finely slice green onions. </li>
    <li> Cut tofu into bite-sized cubes. </li>
    <li> Add konbu and water into pot.  Six grams of konbu and two cups of water should make two servings of miso soup. Place pot over medium-low heat. </li>
    <li> When liquid is simmering, turn off the heat. </li>
    <li> Submerge 7.5 grams of dried bonito flakes into the stock. Close pot with lid and steep the flakes for 7-10 minutes. </li>
    <li> Afterwards, remove konbu and bonito flakes with a fine-mesh strainer. Do not throw these away, as you can use them for other recipes and are edible by themselves. </li>
  </ol>
  <h3> Add Tofu and Wakame </h3>
  <ol>
    <li> Add your bite-sized tofu to the pot. Bring stock back to a simmer over medium heat. </li>
    <li> Once stock starts to simmer, turn off the heat. Add the rehydrated wakame into the stock. </li>
  </ol>
  <h3> Mix Miso Paste into Dashi </h3>
  <ol>
    <li> Add miso paste into the stock. 1 to 2 tbs should be enough, but add according to taste. </li>
    <li> Once everything is properly seasoned, add the green onions as garnish and enjoy! </li>
  </ol>
